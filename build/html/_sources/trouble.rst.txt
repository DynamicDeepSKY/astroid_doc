Troubleshooting 
================

General Problems
----------------

**DDS_DIRECT does not not appear**

* Cut the power and reconnect
* Turn on/off your device's wifi a couple of times
* Connect HDMI to a monitor and see if OS is running. If OS is running and the wifi icon on the top-right corner is showing 'Could not communicate with wpa_supplicant', your WiFi setup is broken. This is currently an issue with V1.0.0. 

    You have two options.
    
    1. If you don't have the HDMI cable and can't see if it is your case, simply running the system recovery will solve the problem.
    
    2. If you already confirmed the problem, open the commandline window and type the following two commands.
    
    Wifi reactivation commands:
    ::

        sudo systemctl enable dhcpcd
        sudo service dhcpcd restart

* Reassemble the housing - wifi signal related problem might disappear


**Video is too slow or there are severe lags**

* Try to get closer to the device. 
* Try other USB cable
* Try other power source

**Not able to connect**

* Cut the power and reconnect
* Turn off and on the device's WiFi a couple of times

You have two options. If you are good at DIY, you can get a new RPi4 2GB model and fit that in. You just need to get a new license codes from us. Just get us your serial number, your name and we will issue a new license for you.
