Dr. Pole 
========

Dr. Pole let you do the EQ mount polar alignment effortlessly even when you do not see the pole star at all or the initial RA axis is pointing far away place from the pole star. This feature makes Astroid's polar alignment ability outstanding among the competition especially in the southern hemisphere (no bright star around the pole) or an urban environment (the pole star is often occluded).  

Setup
----------------------

You can do the polar alignment while Astroid is attached on the telescope lens instead of RA axis. This means that if you adjust DEC axis the camera will not see the same direction with RA axis anymore but this is totally fine with Dr. Pole. This would be especially useful when the pole star is occluded. In such situation, just rotate DEC axis until Astroid can see stars. 

Rotation Axis Finder
----------------------

To start the polar alignment you have to find the RA rotation axis. RA rotation axis can simply found by rotating the RA axis three times. Start the rotation axis finder by clicking the telescope icon on the buttom and follow the instruction on the screen. Remember to turn on the sky recognition before   


However during the rotation axis finder stage, DEC axis should not be moved. 


You can also mount on RA axis if you want.
