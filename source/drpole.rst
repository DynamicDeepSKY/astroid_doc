Dr. Pole 
========

Dr. Pole let you do the polar alignment in the EQ mount effortlessly even when you do not see the pole star at all or the initial RA axis is pointing far away place from the pole star. This feature makes Astroid's polar alignment ability outstanding among the competition especially in the southern hemisphere (no bright star around the pole) or an urban environment (the pole star is often occluded).  

Setup
----------------------

You can do the polar alignment while Astroid is attached on the telescope instead of RA axis. This means when you adjust DEC axis the camera will not see the same direction with RA axis anymore but this is totally fine with Dr. Pole. This would be especially useful when the pole star is occluded. In such situation, rotate DEC axis until Astroid can see stars. 


However during the rotation axis finder stage, DEC axis should not be moved. 


You can also mount on RA axis if you want.
