ARZoom
======================

ARZoom is one of the most interesting features of the Astroid system. This feature is often very useful when you would like to preview your telescope's view. 

Follow the instructions below to use this feature.

1. Turn on the sky recognition and align Astroid to your main telescope. 
2. Now, you should see the ARZoom window on the top right corner.
3. This is the view inside of your telescope's eyepiece.
4. Press +/- button according to your requirement.


ARzoom is currently supported up to 1 degree but we will increase the resolution in near future.
